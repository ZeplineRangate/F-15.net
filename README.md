Client BirefL: Sqn. 444 is a community that hosts tournaments on flight simulators and air combat games like DCS and WT. The players and managers are all aviation enthusiasts that want a site for aviation research and discussion. There is an existing F-16.net. It is for F-16 and F-22 aircrafts, and has an uncomfortable UI design. Therefore, a site for F-15 is asked to be created.
